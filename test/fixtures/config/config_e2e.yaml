        #   are suitable then a peer from another org is chosen.
        # MinBlockHeight:
        #   Chooses the best peer according to a block height lag threshold. The maximum block height of all peers is
        #   determined and the peers whose block heights are under the maximum height but above a provided "lag" threshold are load
        #   balanced. The other peers are not considered.

        # block height falls behind the specified number of blocks and will reconnect to a better performing peer.
        # Note that this parameter is only applicable if peerMonitor is set to Enabled (default).
        # Default: 10
        # NOTES:

        #     affecting performance.
        reconnectBlockHeightLagThreshold: 8

        # [Optional] peerMonitorPeriod is the period in which the connected peer is monitored to see if
